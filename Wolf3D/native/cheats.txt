Ammo & health cache

When you are fighting Hans Gr¨sse, boss of episode 1, go to the main room, the one with all the wall hangings and rows of columns. Go to the left side of the room, there should be three golden swastikas hanging on the wall. Walk up to the middle one and press SPACE. This will open a secret door which leads into a room containing health, ammo, and the chaingun. Visit this room before you take on Hans, and revisit it if you exhaust your ammo during the fray, or take too many hits.
