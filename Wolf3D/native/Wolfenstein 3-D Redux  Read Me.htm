1. Unzip Wolfenstein 3-D Redux to a directory of your choice.

2. Copy your original Wolfenstein 3-D and/or Spear of Destiny data files (They 
   MUST have the extension .WL6 or .SOD) into the sub-directory called base.

   Whereby you replace basedirectory with the directory you unzipped the
   Wolf3D Redux files into. 

3. Now run wolfextractor.exe

4. When wolfextractor.exe has finished successfully run wolf3dredux.exe and
   enjoy.


Notes:
You can switch between Wolfenstein 3-D and Spear of Destiny on-the-fly
by going to console ("~") and typing "g_version 1" for Spear of Destiny or 
"g_version 0" for Wolfenstein 3-D then start a new game.


All of the Wolfenstein 3-D/Spear of Destiny data files remain copyrighted, so 
you can not redistribute data from the original game.

-- Macintosh Wolfenstein 3-D --------------------------------------------------
===============================================================================
How to transfer the Macintosh binary of Wolfenstein 3-D onto the Operating 
System that runs wolfextractor is beyond the scope of this README.

The Mac binary that wolfextractor recognizes is, according to the readme, 
version 1.0.2 of the "Second Encounter". The MD5 checksum of this file is
74ce0dd77716a63bb02294f264078173

You must change the file extension to "mac", example "Wolfenstein3D.mac",
before copying the file into the sub-directory called base.
/basedirectory/wolf3dredux/base/

Whereby you replace basedirectory with the directory you extracted the
Wolf3D Redux files into.

Notes:
This version of wolfextractor does not extract sounds (AIF or IFF),
PICT images or level data.
